## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I did some practice about database: 
> 1)using try sytnx to create a table in database without posint error
> 2)storing data with small columns in to table, such as (province Text, population Integer, area Real)
> 3)using SELECT, WHERE, SUM, etc to change or get the date

> Examples:
> "CREATE TABLE Capitals(province TEXT, capital TEXT, population INTEGER)"

## This Week's Plan

> I want to store the course vs time table into databse.

> Examples: > "CREATE TABLE courses(time TIME, course1 TEXT, course2 TEXT, ... , coursen TEXT)"

## Anything Blocking?

> I'm familiar with mysql but still unfamiliar with redis and php.
> Need to get or access the data from the websit and change them into set.
